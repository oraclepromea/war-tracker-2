# Deprecated Components Directory

⚠️ **This directory is deprecated**

All active components have been moved to `/client/src/components/`. 

## Migration Status
- ✅ LiveNews → `/client/src/components/LiveNews.tsx`
- ✅ WarNews → `/client/src/components/WarNews.tsx`
- ✅ Dashboard → `/client/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ WarEvents → `/client/src/components/WarEvents.tsx`

## Next Steps
1. Use components from `/client/src/components/`
2. Run `npm run dev` from the `/client` directory
3. Consider removing this `/src` directory entirely

The files in this directory are kept as placeholders to prevent import errors during the migration period.
